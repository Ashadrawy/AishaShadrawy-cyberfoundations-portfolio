# Week 4 Lab — The Archive Investigation (CLI Simulator)

**Student Name:** Aisha Shadrawy

**Date Completed:** October 18, 2026

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 4  
**Submission Path:** `week-04/labs/lab-02-wildcards-and-searching.md`

---

## Overview

Lesson 2 gave you the Archive's two tools: patterns that match many filenames at once, and the magnet — `grep` — that searches *inside* files. This lab hands you an Archive of your own and a request slip with three jobs on it: match a set of files with patterns (Part A), hunt down a suspicious log entry with grep (Part B), and run the full find → check → lock down audit that combines this week's two lessons into one workflow (Part C). This lab is more independent than Lab 01 — the steps tell you *what* to accomplish, and the *how* is mostly on you. One screenshot from this lab becomes part of ★ Deliverable 1.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations CLI Simulator (browser-based, inside the Lab Portal) |
| Shell | **Bash is REQUIRED** for Parts A, B and C (Archive Investigation — Bash, challenges 1–8). The four Archive Investigation — PowerShell challenges are **optional extra practice** — they do not replace any bash step, and there is no PowerShell permission-change step. |
| Paths | Simulated Linux-style paths such as `/home/morgan/archive` — this is not your real Windows or Mac computer |
| Prerequisite | Week 4, Lessons 1 and 2 completed; Lab 01 recommended first |

**Before you start**

1. Sign in to the Lab Portal and open **Week 4 → CLI Simulator**.
2. Open **Foundry District Archive Investigation — Bash**.
3. Check the prompt. Every challenge starts in `/home/morgan/archive`, a folder of **11 files** — invoices, logs and notes. Type `pwd` if you are unsure.
4. Know about fresh starts. **Every challenge gives you a brand-new copy of the Archive.** Folders you made or permissions you changed in an earlier challenge will not carry over. That is expected.
5. Know the two kinds of saving. **Next** in the simulator only moves to the next challenge (simulator progress saves automatically). Your typed answers in **this worksheet** are saved only when you click **Save Progress** here in the Lab Portal.

**Which challenge goes with which step**

| Simulator challenge (Bash) | Worksheet step |
|---|---|
| 1 — Survey | Part A, Step 1 |
| 2 — Every invoice | Part A, Step 2 |
| 3 — March invoices only | Part A, Step 3 |
| 4 — Wildcard copy + list | Part A, Step 4 |
| 5 — Search one log | Part B, Steps 1–2 |
| 6 — Search every log | Part B, Step 3 |
| 7 — Find the badge-code file | Part C, Step 1 |
| 8 — Search again, check, change, check | Part C, Steps 2–4 (and the screenshot) |

## Part A — Work the Request Slip

### Step 1 — Survey the Archive

*Simulator: challenge 1.* Before filtering anything, run a plain listing of the Archive folder (`ls`). You don't need to record every filename — just note roughly how many files there are and what naming families you can see (invoices, logs, notes…).

What you observed (rough count + the naming families you spotted):

```
There are 11 files, which include door access, inventories, meeting notes and supply lists. 
```

### Step 2 — Match One Family With a Pattern

*Simulator: challenge 2.* The slip's first request: **every invoice file.** Write a pattern that matches all of them and *only* them, and test it with `ls` — remember the habit: pattern first, look at what it catches, then act.

Command you ran (your ls + pattern):

```
ls inv-*
```

Output (the matched files):

```
inv-april.txt
inv-february.txt
inv-january.txt
inv-march-supplement.txt
inv-march.txt
```

### Step 3 — Get Precise

*Simulator: challenge 3.* The slip gets pickier: **only the March invoices**. Refine your pattern so it catches exactly those — no other months and no non-invoice files — you may need a second `*`, a `?`, or a `[ ]` set, depending on how the names are built.

Command you ran:

```
ls inv-march*
```

Output (the matched files — and nothing extra):

```
inv-march-supplement.txt
inv-march.txt
```

### Step 4 — Act on a Pattern

*Simulator: challenge 4* (fresh Archive — make the folder again).

1. Create a folder named `evidence`.
2. Copy **both** March invoices into it with **one** `cp` command that uses your Step 3 pattern. Copy — don't move — so the originals stay put.
3. Confirm with `ls evidence`. You should see exactly the two March invoices.

Commands you ran (mkdir, cp with pattern, confirming ls):

```
mkdir evidence
ls
cp inv-march* evidence
ls
```

## Part B — Run the Magnet

### Step 1 — Search One File

*Simulator: challenge 5.* The slip's second request: `door-access.log` records badge events, and somewhere in it are **denied entries**. Search **that one file** with `grep` for the denied entries — and remember the Strict Teacher: the log writes in CAPS, so decide whether you need the case-insensitive flag or the exact capitals. Showing the whole file with `cat` does not count.

Command you ran:

```
grep "DENIED" door-access.log
```

Output (every matching line):

```
08:12 DENIED badge 2214 east door - retry OK
12:40 DENIED visitor badge front desk
02:47 DENIED badge 4471 storeroom door
```

### Step 2 — Find the Line That Matters

*Same search as Step 1.* Most denied entries are routine — mistyped badges at reasonable hours. One is not. Identify the suspicious line (think: what *time* would worry you?) and record it exactly.

The suspicious line, and why you flagged it:

```
Why is someone attempting to open a storeroom door at 2:47am
```

### Step 3 — Widen the Sweep

*Simulator: challenge 6.* One log is never the whole story. Re-run your search across **every** `.log` file in one command — a pattern where the filename goes. Note which files your suspicious word appears in.

Command you ran:

```
grep "DENIED" *.log
```

Which files contained matches:

```
door-access.log:08:12 DENIED badge 2214 east door - retry OK
door-access.log:12:40 DENIED visitor badge front desk
door-access.log:02:47 DENIED badge 4471 storeroom door
west-access.log:13:22 DENIED badge 9911 west door - unknown badge
```

## Part C — Find, Check, Lock Down

The slip's last request is the real test: **somewhere in this Archive is a file listing storeroom badge codes.** You don't know its name. You know what's inside it.

### Step 1 — Find It by Its Contents

*Simulator: challenge 7.* Search every `.txt` file for the term `badge-code`, in one command. Record which file comes back.

Command you ran:

```
grep "badge-code" *.txt
```

The file you found:

```
meeting-recap.txt:Action: rotate the storeroom badge-code list this quarter
```

### Step 2 — Check Who Can Touch It

*Simulator: challenge 8* (fresh Archive). Do Steps 2–4 in this order in ONE session so your screenshot tells the whole story:

1. Re-run your Step 1 search across every `.txt` file.
2. Run `ls -l` (BEFORE) and read the found file's rings.

Before you walk away — this is the Week 4 reflex now — read the long listing for that file. Record what you find. Is this file as locked down as its contents deserve?

Command you ran and its output:

```
cat meetin-recap.txt
```

Your read of the situation:

```
Recap - facilities sync
Action: rotate the storeroom badge-code list this quarter
Current codes: 4471 west, 8832 north, 2214 east

It lists the codes for the door, which is information that should be limited. 
```

### Step 3 — Lock It Down

*Still challenge 8.*

3. Change the file's permissions so only its owner can read and write it.
4. Run `ls -l` again (AFTER). The simulator checks this order: search, BEFORE listing, change, AFTER listing.

Commands you ran (including both ls -l checks):

```
ls -l
chmod go-rw meeting-recap.txt
ls -l
```

The file's permission string BEFORE and AFTER:

```
-rw-rw-rw- 1 morgan foundry   129 meeting-recap.txt
-rw------- 1 morgan foundry   129 meeting-recap.txt
```

### Step 4 — Capture Your Investigation Evidence (REQUIRED screenshot)

*Still challenge 8.*

1. Scroll so one screen shows the search result, the BEFORE `ls -l`, your `chmod`, and the AFTER `ls -l`.
2. Take a screenshot and save it on your computer as `cli-search-investigation.png` (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces).

**This screenshot is REQUIRED — it is part of ★ Deliverable 1.** You will upload and link it in the GitHub Commit section below.

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** In Part A you tested every pattern with `ls` before letting `cp` act on it. Explain what could go wrong if you skipped straight to acting — and why the stakes get higher when the command attached to the pattern is `rm`. *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
Testing patterns with ls first helps me confirm which files will be affected before running a command. If i skip this step, I could copy the wrong files or accidentally delete important files if I use rm.
```

**Analysis Question 2.** Your Part B search returned several routine matches and one suspicious one. In a real security job, why is "reducing six hundred lines to three worth reading" often more valuable than any single answer the search returns? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
Reducing six hundred lines to 3 makes it easier to find important information without wasting time reading everything. In cybersecurity, it helps professionals identify suspicious activity faster and focus on possible threats. 
```

**Analysis Question 3.** Part C found a sensitive file by its *contents*, then audited its *permissions*. Explain why neither skill alone would have been enough — what does each half of the workflow catch that the other misses? *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
Searching file contents helps me find sensitive information that might be overlooked. Checking file permissions shows who ca access or read that information. Both steps are important because finding sensitive information does not tell me whether it is properly protected, and checking permissions alone does not tell me what information a file contains. 
```

**Analysis Question 4.** The Archive had eleven files; real systems have millions. Which habit from this lab do you think scales up the furthest into professional work, and why? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
I think testing commands before running them is the habit that will scale up the furthest in professional work. Real systems contain many files, and checking what a command will affect can help prevent mistakes, data loss, and security problems. 
```
