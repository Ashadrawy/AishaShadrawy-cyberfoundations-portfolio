# Week 4 Lab — File Permissions: The Badge Audit (CLI Simulator)

**Student Name:** Aisha Shadrawy

**Date Completed:** October 18, 2026

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 4  
**Submission Path:** `week-04/labs/lab-01-file-permissions.md`

---

## Overview

Lesson 1 revealed what Ivy's badge rings mean: every file carries permissions — who may read, write, and execute it — and one wrongly-set ring can be a whole security incident. This lab has you run a small permissions audit of your own in the CLI Simulator: read the rings on a set of seeded files (Part A), fix three problems deliberately with `chmod` (Part B), and read the same story on the Windows side with `Get-Acl` (Part C). One screenshot from this lab becomes part of ★ Deliverable 1.

**Nothing here can break anything real.** The CLI Simulator is a consequence-free practice space — exactly the right place to change permissions for the first time.

---

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations CLI Simulator (browser-based, inside the Lab Portal) — no install, no VM, no real terminal required |
| Shell | Parts A and B **require bash**. Part C **requires PowerShell** (`Get-Acl`). |
| Paths | Simulated Linux-style paths such as `/home/morgan/badge-office` — this is not your real Windows or Mac computer |
| Prerequisite | Week 4, Lesson 1 completed |

**Before you start**

1. Sign in to the Lab Portal and open **Week 4 → CLI Simulator**.
2. Open **Foundry District Badge Office — Bash** (Parts A and B). You will use **Badge Office — PowerShell** later for Part C.
3. Check the prompt. Every challenge starts in `/home/morgan/badge-office`. Type `pwd` if you are unsure.
4. Know about fresh starts. **Every challenge gives you a brand-new copy of the folder** (the divider says `fresh filesystem for this challenge`). Changes from an earlier challenge will not carry over. That is expected — it is not lost work.
5. Know the two kinds of saving. **Next** in the simulator only moves to the next challenge (your simulator progress is saved automatically). Your typed answers in **this worksheet** are saved only when you click **Save Progress** here in the Lab Portal.

**Which challenge goes with which step**

| Simulator challenge | Worksheet step |
|---|---|
| Badge Office — Bash, challenge 1 | Part A, Steps 1–2 |
| Badge Office — Bash, challenge 2 | Part A, Step 3 |
| Badge Office — Bash, challenge 3 | Part B, Step 1 |
| Badge Office — Bash, challenge 4 | Part B, Step 2 |
| Badge Office — Bash, challenge 5 | Part B, Step 3 **and** the Step 4 screenshot |
| Badge Office — PowerShell, challenge 1 | Part C |

## Part A — Read the Rings

### Step 1 — Get the Security Report

*Simulator: Badge Office — Bash, challenge 1.*

1. Run the long listing: `ls -l` (`ls -la` also works).
2. Copy the command and the full listing into the boxes below.

This is Week 3's `ls` with one flag added — and that flag turns it into a per-file security report.

Command you ran:

```
ls -l
```

Output (the full listing):

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    82 badge-codes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 cleanup.sh
-rw-rw-rw- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 shift-notes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    49 supply-list.txt
```

### Step 2 — Decode One File Completely

*Same listing as Step 1 — no new command needed.*

Pick any one file from your listing and decode its full permission string, audience by audience — owner, group, other — the way Lesson 1 decoded `-rwxr-xr--`. Write it as plain-English sentences ("the owner can…, the group can…, everyone else can…").

The file and its permission string:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    82 badge-codes.txt
```

Your plain-English decode:

```
The owner can read and write. The group can read. The other can read.
```

### Step 3 — Find the Problem File

*Simulator: Badge Office — Bash, challenge 2.* Run `ls -l` again in this fresh challenge, then read it.

One file in this folder is dramatically more permissive than it should be — every ring lit for every audience, or close to it. Find it. (Hint: scan the *other* triplet — the last three characters — down the whole listing. Which file gives strangers the most?)

The most permissive file and why you flagged it:

```
-rw-rw-rw- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt
The group and other area allowed to read and write the file, it allows too much permission to the unknown.
```

---

## Part B — Change the Rings

This is your first time changing permissions, so we follow THE GATEKEEPER'S RULE on every single change: **check who can touch it now, change it, then check again.** That means `ls -l` before *and after* every `chmod`. The simulator checks the order: a listing that shows the file **before** your first change, and another listing **after** your last change. A change without both checks will not pass.

### Step 1 — Lock Down the Problem File

*Simulator: Badge Office — Bash, challenge 3.*

1. Run `ls -l` (BEFORE).
2. Revoke write from the group (`g-w`) on the problem file from Part A, Step 3.
3. Revoke read and write from other.
4. Run `ls -l` again (AFTER).

Commands you ran (in order, including both ls -l checks):

```
ls -l
chmod g-w master-inventory.txt
ls -l
chmod o-rw master-inventory.txt
ls -l
```

The file's permission string BEFORE and AFTER:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    82 badge-codes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 cleanup.sh
-rw-r--rw- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 shift-notes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    49 supply-list.txt

-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    82 badge-codes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 cleanup.sh
-rw-r----- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 shift-notes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    49 supply-list.txt
```

### Step 2 — Make a Script Runnable

*Simulator: Badge Office — Bash, challenge 4.*

1. Run `ls -l` (BEFORE).
2. Find the script (its name ends in `.sh`). Grant execute to the owner — and only the owner.
3. Run `ls -l` again (AFTER).

Commands you ran:

```
ls -l
chmod u+x cleanup.sh
ls -l
```

Output (the script's corrected permission string):

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    82 badge-codes.txt
-rwxr--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 cleanup.sh
-rw-rw-rw- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 shift-notes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    49 supply-list.txt
```

### Step 3 — Protect the Secrets File

*Simulator: Badge Office — Bash, challenge 5.*

1. Run `ls -l` (BEFORE).
2. Find the file whose name says it should not be readable by everyone. Revoke other's read.
3. Run `ls -l` again (AFTER).

You will stay in this same challenge for the Step 4 screenshot.

Commands you ran:

```
ls -l
chmod o-r badge-codes.txt
```

Output (the corrected permission string):

```
-rw-r----- 1 morgan foundry    82 badge-codes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 cleanup.sh
-rw-rw-rw- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 shift-notes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    49 supply-list.txt
```

### Step 4 — Capture Your Audit Evidence (REQUIRED screenshot)

**Do this inside Badge Office — Bash, challenge 5** (fresh folder, so all three problems are back). This builds one screen that shows the whole audit.

1. Run `ls -l` first. This is your **BEFORE** listing.
2. Replay all three fixes, one after another:

```bash
chmod g-w master-inventory.txt
chmod o-rw master-inventory.txt
chmod u+x cleanup.sh
chmod o-r badge-codes.txt
```

3. Run `ls -l` again. This is your **AFTER** listing.
4. Check the screen. You should see BOTH listings, and the AFTER listing must show all three targets fixed: `master-inventory.txt`, `cleanup.sh` and `badge-codes.txt`. Scroll so all of it is visible.
5. Take a screenshot and save it on your computer as `cli-permissions-audit.png` (lowercase, hyphens, no spaces).

**This screenshot is REQUIRED — it is part of ★ Deliverable 1.** You will upload it and link it in the GitHub Commit section below.

## Part C — The Same Story, Windows Edition

### Step 1 — Read One File's Guest List

*Simulator: Badge Office — PowerShell, challenge 1* (starts in `/home/morgan/badge-office`).

1. Run `Get-Acl shift-notes.txt` (or `Get-Acl -Path shift-notes.txt`). Only this file counts for the challenge.
2. Find the **Owner** line and the **Access** line, and copy them below.

On a real Windows computer, `Get-Acl` lists named accounts and their rights. This simulator keeps it short: one Owner line and one Access line. It runs on the same simulated Linux-style folder, not on your real computer.

Command you ran:

```
get-acl shift-notes.txt
```

Output (the Owner line and the Access line):

```
Path : shift-notes.txt
Owner : morgan
Access : -rw-r--r--
```

### Step 2 — Translate One Entry

Take the access entry from your output and translate it into plain English, the same way you decoded the Linux string in Part A.

Your plain-English translation:

```
Morgan, the owner can read and write. 
The group can read.
Other can read.

```

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** In Part A you found the problem file by scanning the *other* triplet. Why is the "other" audience usually the most important one to audit first on a shared system? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
"Other" is the unknown people. They are given access to specific files. It must be verified so they are not granted access to company information that should not be changed or allowed for anyone to see. 
```

**Analysis Question 2.** THE GATEKEEPER'S RULE requires a check before *and* after every change, even though `chmod` rarely fails. What does the *before* check protect you from, and what does the *after* check protect you from? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
The before check, allows to to verify the location that you are in and it is correct, so you are not changing the wrong information, or in the wrong file. The after, allows you to verify the correct change was completed in the correct file. 
```

**Analysis Question 3.** Lesson 1 called least privilege "granting what's needed and revoking the rest." Pick one of your three fixes from Part B and explain it in least-privilege terms: what was granted that wasn't needed, and who could have taken advantage? *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
I used chmod o-r badge-codes.txt to remove read permission from others. Before the change, people outside the owner and group could read the file, even though they did not need the access. Someone unauthorized could have taken advantage of this to view sensitive badge codes. Removing that permission follows the principle of least privilege by allowing the owner and group to read the file. 
```

**Analysis Question 4.** Windows ACLs can name specific people; Linux permissions use three fixed audiences. Describe one situation where the Windows approach would be genuinely more useful — and one cost of that extra flexibility. *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
Windows ACLS are more useful when a specific employee needs access to a file but other employees in the same group should not have access. One cost is that managing permissions can become more complicated because administrators must keep track of individual users and their access rights. 
```

## GitHub Commit Subsection

This lab's written answers are submitted through the **CyberFoundations Lab Portal**. Do the screenshot steps first, then submit.

**📸 REQUIRED — upload your Deliverable 1 screenshot to GitHub**

1. Go to your own portfolio repository on GitHub.com.
2. Open the folder `assets/screenshots/week-04/`. If it does not exist yet, click **Add file → Create new file**, type `assets/screenshots/week-04/README.md`, add one line of text, and click **Commit changes**.
3. Inside `assets/screenshots/week-04/`, click **Add file → Upload files**.
4. Drag in `cli-permissions-audit.png` and click **Commit changes**.

**🔗 Link the screenshot in the portal**

5. On GitHub, click the uploaded file name, then click **Raw** (or the download icon). The image opens on its own.
6. Copy the address from your browser's address bar. It should start with `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/`.
7. Back in the Lab Portal, paste it into the screenshot box labeled **Permissions audit — final ls -l** (just below). A green "Looks like an image address" message and a preview should appear.
   - Do not paste a `github.com/.../blob/...` page link or a file path from your computer — the box will reject them.
   - If your repository is private, the preview may not load. That is fine; the link still points to your image.

**✅ Submit**

8. Click **Save Progress** to save your answers and the link.
9. Connect GitHub if you haven't already (one-time setup) and select your portfolio repo.
10. Click **Submit to GitHub**. The Portal commits this worksheet to `week-04/labs/lab-01-file-permissions.md`. It commits your answers and the image link — not the image file itself, which is why step 4 matters.
11. Open the committed file on GitHub and check that the screenshot shows. If you change anything later, click **Save Progress** and **Submit to GitHub** again.
