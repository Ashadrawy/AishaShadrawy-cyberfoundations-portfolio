## Overview

Lesson 4 showed you the three panes of a packet analyzer — the packet list, the detail pane, and the filter bar — and told you that professionals live in this tool. This lab is where you stop watching and start driving. You'll open a recorded minute of traffic on The Grid and read it packet by packet: a name lookup (Part B), a handshake and the message that followed it (Part C), and one conversation that refuses to be read at all.

**The capture is the same for every student.** It's a simplified teaching capture, not a live network — fifteen packets, built to show one idea at a time and replayed identically for everyone. Real captures contain far more, and a real HTTPS conversation contains more TLS packets than the one shown here. That means your numbers should match your classmates' exactly. If yours don't, you've filtered something out; clear the filter and look again.

**Nothing here can break anything.** You are reading a recording. There is no traffic to disturb and nothing to configure.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations **Packet Inspector** — browser-based, inside the Lab Portal. Nothing to install. You will never install Wireshark for this course |
| Where to find it | Lab Portal main navigation, alongside the **CLI Simulator** |
| Capture | "The Grid — Workstation Capture." Canned and identical for every student |
| Prerequisite | Week 5, Lesson 3 (ports, the handshake) and Lesson 4 (the three panes) completed. Lab 01 recommended first — Part B builds directly on it |
| Filters available | `dns` · `icmp` · `tcp` · `udp` · `http` · `tls` · `ip.addr == x.x.x.x` · `tcp.port == N` · `udp.port == N`. A filter the inspector doesn't understand shows a red message instead of a list — fix the spelling and try again |
| Time | Plan for 30–40 minutes, including this worksheet |

**Before you start:** log into the Lab Portal, open **Week 5 → Packet Inspector**, and load the capture named **"The Grid — Workstation Capture."** You should see a list of packets across the top, an empty detail pane below it, and a filter bar above everything. **Two-tab workflow:** keep this worksheet open in a second browser tab — look in the Inspector tab, record here, and Save Progress as you go.

**Get your screenshot tool ready now.** **Windows:** `Win + Shift + S` · **Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + 4`, then drag to capture. You'll need it twice in this lab, and both screenshots are required.

**A note on filters:** a filter never deletes packets. It hides the ones that don't match so you can concentrate. Clearing the filter box brings everything back. This matters in Part A — count *before* you filter anything.

---

## Part A — Orientation

### Step 1 — Count the Whole Capture

With the filter bar **empty**, look at the packet list and count how many packets the capture contains. Every packet has a number in the first column, so the last row tells you the answer without counting by hand.

The total number of packets in the capture:

```
15
```

### Step 2 — Inventory the Protocols

Scan the **Protocol** column from top to bottom and write down every distinct protocol name you see. There are five. You met all five in Lessons 2, 3 and 4 — this is the first time you're seeing them as labelled traffic rather than as ideas.

The protocols that appear in this capture:

```
DNS
ICMP
TCP
TLS
HTTP
```

### Step 3 — Read the Columns

Four columns do most of the work in a packet analyzer. In your own words — not the Lesson 4 wording — write one plain sentence for each: what does it tell you, and what question does it answer?

What the Source column tells you:

```
The source column shows the IP address of the device that sent the packet
```

What the Destination column tells you:

```
The destination column shows the IP address of the device receiving the packet
```

What the Protocol column tells you:

```
The protocol column identifies the type of communication being used.
```

What the Info column tells you:

```
The info column provides details about what is happening in the packet. 
```

### Step 4 — Spot Your Own Machine

One address appears more often than any other, and it's the one sending most of the requests. That's the workstation the capture was taken from — the same address you recorded in Lab 01.

The workstation's IP address, and how you worked out it was the workstation:

```
The workstation IP address is 10.20.5.42. This IP address appears repeatedly as the source of requests sent to other devices. 
```

---

## Part B — Follow a DNS Lookup

In Lab 01 you ran `dig foundry-archive.grid.local` and read a tidy answer: a name went in, an IP address came out. You saw the *result*. Now you're going to see the actual conversation that produced it — the question travelling across the wire and the answer coming back.

### Step 1 — Filter for DNS

Type `dns` into the filter bar and apply it. The packet list shrinks to the name-lookup traffic only.

The packet numbers that remain after the `dns` filter:

```
1
2
```

### Step 2 — Read the Question

Click the first of your two DNS packets and read its Info column and detail pane. This is the query — your workstation asking the Directory Board a question.

The packet number of the query, and the name being asked about:

```
Packet 1, foundy-archive.grid.local
```

The source and destination addresses of the query — who asked, and who was asked:

```
the sourced, who asked: 10.20.5.42
destination, who was asked:10.20.5.10
```

### Step 3 — Read the Answer

Now click the second DNS packet. This is the response coming back the other way.

The packet number of the response, and the IP address it returned:

```
packet 2, 10.20.5.20
```

### Step 4 — Find the Door

DNS doesn't just travel to an address — it travels to a specific **port** on that address, the way Lesson 3 described a numbered door on a building. Open the detail pane on either DNS packet and find the port number the lookup used.

The port number DNS used here:

```
53
```

### Step 5 — Tie It Back to Lab 01

This is the same lookup you ran with `dig` in Lab 01 — same name, same answer, same DNS server. The difference is the altitude you're viewing it from. `dig` handed you the conclusion; the Packet Inspector shows you the two messages that produced it.

In two or three sentences: what did the packet view show you that `dig` did not?

```
The packet view showed the actual DNS query traveling form my workstation, 10.20.5.42, to the DNS server, 10.20.5.10, followed by the response returning the IP address 10.20.5.20. Unlike 'dig' which displays the lookup result, the packet view showed the communication between the two devices and the ports used. 
```

### Step 6 — Capture Screenshot 1 (REQUIRED)

With the `dns` filter still applied and one of the two DNS packets selected, take a screenshot showing the filter bar, the filtered packet list, and the detail pane. Name it exactly **`packet-dns-query.png`**. Upload instructions are in the GitHub Commit section.

## Part C — Doors and the Handshake

Lesson 3 told the TCP handshake as a knock at a door: **SYN** ("knock"), **SYN-ACK** ("who's there — come in"), **ACK** ("thanks"). You're about to watch one happen.

### Step 1 — Filter for Port 443

Clear the `dns` filter and enter `tcp.port == 443` instead. Port 443 is HTTPS — one of the well-known doors from Lesson 3.

The packet numbers that remain after the `tcp.port == 443` filter:

```
7
8
9
10
```

### Step 2 — Identify the Three-Step Handshake

Three of those packets are the handshake itself. Find each one by reading the flags in the Info column, and record its number, its direction (which address sent it to which), and which step of the handshake it is.

The SYN — packet number and direction:

```
packet 7- 10.20.5.42  -> 10.20.5.20. The workstation initiates the connection
```

The SYN-ACK — packet number and direction:

```
packet 8- 10.20.5.20 -> 10.20.5.42. The server responds and agrees to the connection
```

The ACK — packet number and direction:

```
packet 9- 10.20.5.42 -> 10.20.5.20. The workstation acknowledges the response and completes the handshake.
```

### Step 3 — Notice the Two Port Numbers

Look at the Info column on the SYN packet. Two port numbers appear: a high, odd-looking one on your workstation's side, and 443 on the server's side. Only one of them is a "well-known door" — the other is a temporary one your machine picked for this conversation.

The two port numbers, and which belongs to the server:

```
port 51514- temporary port
port 443- the servers port
```

### Step 4 — Switch to the Plain Conversation

Clear the filter and enter `http` instead. This is a different conversation to a different machine on The Grid — the notice board — on port 80.

The packet numbers that remain after the `http` filter:

```
14
15
```

### Step 5 — Open the Request and Read It

Click **packet 14** and expand its detail pane all the way. Unlike everything you've read so far, this packet's contents are ordinary text — you can simply read them, the way you'd read a note left on a desk.

The request line at the top of packet 14 (the method, the page, and the version):

```
GET /shift-notice.html HTTP/1.1
```

The Host line — which machine the request was addressed to:

```
Host: grid-notice.grid.local
```

Every other readable line in packet 14's detail pane:

```
User-Agent: GridBrowser/2.4
X-Staff-Code: FOUNDRY-2026-STOREROOM
```

### Step 6 — Notice What You Just Read

One of those lines is not like the others. It carries a value that looks like an internal code rather than a technical setting.

The name of that header and the exact value it carries:

```
X-Staff-Code: FOUNDRY-2026-STOREROOM
```

In one or two sentences: if you were sitting on this network with a packet analyzer open, what would you now know that you were never meant to know?

```
I would know the internal staff code FOUNDRY-2026-STOREROOM because the HTTP traffic is unencrypted and the information is readable in the packet capture. Anyone able to capture the traffic could potentially see sensitive information that should be protected. 
```

### Step 7 — Capture Screenshot 2 (REQUIRED)

With the `http` filter applied and **packet 14** selected and expanded so the readable lines are visible, take a screenshot. Name it exactly **`packet-http-plaintext.png`**.

### Step 8 — Now Try to Read the Other One

Clear the filter and click **packet 10** — the TLS **Client Hello** from the port 443 conversation you examined in Steps 1–3. Expand its detail pane and compare it with packet 14.

> **Run →** clear the filter, click packet 10 · **Look for →** the *Transport Layer Security* layers and the raw bytes at the bottom · **Record →** what you see, in your own words

Here's what's really going on. The Client Hello is the browser's opening "hello" in the TLS handshake — it offers which TLS versions and ciphers it supports and names the site it wants (`foundry-archive.grid.local`). It is **binary**, so the bottom pane shows bytes (`16` = a handshake record, `01` = Client Hello) instead of words like packet 14. But it is **not secret**: the inspector has already decoded those bytes into the fields above. **Not being plain text is not the same thing as being encrypted.**

What TLS protects comes *after* the handshake finishes: the actual page request and response travel as encrypted **application data**. If packet 14's request had been sent over HTTPS, an eavesdropper would see that encrypted application data — the address, ports and size — but not the `X-Staff-Code` line. This simplified capture leaves those later TLS packets out.

What packet 10's detail pane shows you, described in your own words:

```
Packet 10 shows my computer starting a secure connection to foundry-archive.grid.local using port 443. It shows the security versions and settings my computer can use. The information appears as raw bytes instead of regular words, but it is not encrypted. Once the secure connection is established, the website information is encrypted so someone watching the network cannot read private details.  
```

Compare it to packet 14 — what can you tell about packet 10 from the packet list and its decoded fields, and what would an eavesdropper *not* be able to read once the HTTPS conversation moved on to encrypted application data?

```
Packet 10 shows my computer starting a secure connection to the archive server using HTTPS. I can see the server name and the security settings being used, but I cannot read the actual website information. Once the connection is encrypted, someone watching the network would not be able to see the page being requested or sensitive information like the staff code. 
```

**You'll go deeper later in the course** (Week 9 covers certificates and TLS). For now, hold onto the distinction: the handshake is visible and decodable; the conversation it protects is not. Analysis Question 4 asks what you make of it.

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** In Part A you counted the packets before applying any filter. Explain why a filter is a *view* rather than a deletion, and describe a situation where forgetting that could lead an analyst to a wrong conclusion. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
A filter only changes what I see on the screen. It does not delete or remove packets from the original capture. If i forget this, I might think certain network activity never happened simply because it is hidden by the filter.
```

**Analysis Question 2.** You have now seen the same DNS lookup twice — once as `dig` output in Lab 01, once as two packets here. Describe what each view is good for, and name one investigation where you would specifically want the packet view. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
The 'dig' command shows the DNS lookup result, including the IP address connected to a website name. The packet view shows the actual messages traveling between my computer and the DNS server. I would want to use the packet view when investigating a possible network problem to see whether the DNS request was sent and whether a response came back.
```

**Analysis Question 3.** The handshake took three packets and about three milliseconds before a single byte of real content moved. Using the knock-at-the-door analogy from Lesson 3, explain what those three packets accomplish and why a connection would be less reliable without them. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
The three-way handshake is like knocking on a door before starting a conversation. The first packet asks to connect, the second packet responds that it is ready, the third packet confirms the connection. This makes sure both computers are ready to communicate before sending information. Without the handshake, the connection would be less reliable because the computers would not confirm that they were ready to communicate. 
```

**Analysis Question 4.** You read packet 14 word for word as plain text, while packet 10 was a decoded TLS handshake with no readable page content — same capture, same network, same workstation. What do you think explains the difference between plain HTTP and HTTPS here, and what would TLS have protected once the handshake finished? And why does it matter that the one you *could* read contained a staff code? Give us your best reasoning from what you observed. *(Minimum 4 sentences.)*

```
Packet 14 used HTTP, which sends information in a way that can be read by anyone capturing the network traffic. Packet 10 used HTTPS, which starts a secure connection that encrypts the information sent after the handshake is finished. This means someone watching the network would not be able to read private information being sent through HTTPS. It matters that packet 14 showed a staff code because anyone capturing that traffic could see and potentially misuse it. This shows why using HTTPS is important when sending sensitive information.
