# Week 6 Notes — Cloud Heights: Cloud VMs, SSH, VNets & Layers

**Student Name:** Aisha Shadrawy

**Date Completed:** November 7, 2026

Summarize this week's key concepts in your own words — not copy-pasted definitions. This week moved from the simulated Grid into a real cloud environment, so focus on what you personally observed as well as what each term means.

> **Cloud Heights Security Rule:** Your Bastion shareable link and Cloud Heights password are private access credentials. Never paste either into this file, a screenshot, your GitHub repository, Circle, or a chat message.

## Key Concepts This Week

- **Cloud** — other people's computers, professionally operated and reached over a network
- **Datacenter** — the physical facility where cloud computing equipment lives
- **Region** — a geographic area where a cloud provider operates datacenters
- **Virtual machine (VM)** — a computer created in software; in Cloud Heights, your VM runs on hardware in a real datacenter
- **IaaS / PaaS / SaaS** — different levels of cloud service: rent the room, rent the workshop, or rent the finished service
- **Shared responsibility model** — the cloud provider secures the building and underlying platform; the customer is still responsible for what belongs to them
- **Provisioning** — creating and preparing a resource so it is ready to use
- **Golden image / snapshot** — a known starting point that can be used to create consistent machines
- **Snapshot vs backup** — a snapshot is a point-in-time copy used for recovery or cloning; a backup is a separate recovery copy with a different purpose
- **Azure Bastion** — the guarded front desk that gives you browser-based SSH access without giving your VM a public IP
- **Bastion shareable link** — sensitive access information that must never be committed to GitHub or exposed in screenshots
- **SSH (Secure Shell)** — remote command-line access to another machine
- **SSH client and server** — the client starts the connection; the server listens and answers
- **Port 22** — the standard numbered door used by SSH
- **Host / fingerprint verification** — the verify-before-approve habit when connecting to a host for the first time
- **Authentication** — proving that you are the account you claim to be
- **Remote session / remote shell** — the live command-line session running on another machine
- **Getting TO vs getting INTO a machine** — network reachability and authentication are different problems
- **`hostname`** — asks which machine you are on
- **`whoami`** — asks which account you are using
- **`pwd`** — asks where you are in the filesystem
- **Private IP address** — an address used inside a private network rather than directly on the public internet
- **Virtual network (VNet)** — the private cloud neighborhood where resources communicate
- **Subnet** — a smaller address range inside a VNet; a floor inside the larger building
- **NAT / outbound translation** — lets a privately addressed machine communicate outward without giving the machine its own public IP
- **Network Security Group (NSG)** — the network guard post that controls what traffic is allowed; you take control of these rules in Week 7
- **Known-good reference point** — a target whose expected behavior gives you something reliable to compare against
- **Grid Beacon** — the known-good Cloud Heights host at `10.60.6.4`
- **The silent Azure gateway** — Azure's default gateway may not answer ICMP ping even when the network is healthy
- **OSI model** — the seven-layer vocabulary used to organize network and application behavior
- **TCP/IP model** — the more compact layer model commonly used by practitioners
- **Layers** — a way to separate different jobs in a communication path so troubleshooting can be systematic
- **Encapsulation** — information travelling inside other information, like a letter inside an envelope inside a mailbag
- **The Ladder Rule in the real cloud** — work outward, prove what works, use the route and a known-good target, and never let one silent tool response choose the culprit by itself

## My Cloud Heights Command Table

You used these commands on a real Ubuntu machine this week. Instead of memorizing syntax, write down the **question each command answers** or the job it performs.

| Command | What question does it answer / what does it do? |
| --- | --- |
| `hostname` | Tells me which computer I am using |
| `whoami` | Tells me which account I am using |
| `pwd` | Shows my current location in the system |
| `ip addr` | Shows my machine's IP address and ntework interfaces |
| `ip route` | Shows where my network traffis is supposed to go  |
| `ping` | Checks whether another machines responds over the network |
| `traceroute` | Shows the pathe traffic takes toward another machine |
| `dig` | Looks up DNS information, such as the hostname's IP address |
| `curl` | Requests information from a website or service |
| `ssh` | Connects securly to another computer |
| `exit` | Ends my current shell or remote sessions. |

## In My Own Words

### 1. Getting TO vs Getting INTO

Explain the difference between getting **TO** a machine and getting **INTO** a machine. Use something you personally observed in Cloud Heights as evidence.

```
Getting to a machine means my network connection can reach it. Getting into a machine means I have permission to log in. In Cloud Heights, SSH connected me to my VM, but I still needed to authenticate before I could use it. 
```

### 2. The Silent Gateway

Your Azure gateway did not answer `ping`, but your VM was still healthy. Explain how you proved the network was working and what this taught you about interpreting tool output.

```
My Azure gateway didn't answer my ping, but that didn't mean it was broken. I successfully connected to the Grid Beacon, which proved my local network worked. My default route was also configured, and successful outbound internet access would confirm that I could reach outside my subset. I learned that one failed test does not always mean something is wrong. 
```

### 3. Private on the Inside, Connected to the Outside

Explain how your Cloud Heights VM can reach the internet even though it has only a private IP address. Then explain how **you** reach the VM from outside its VNet.

```
My VM has a private IP address, but NAT allows it to communicate with the internet. When I need to connect to my VM from outside the network, I use Azure Bastion through my browser. This allows secure access without giving my VM a public IP address. 
```

### 4. VNet vs Subnet

Explain the difference between a VNet and a subnet using the Cloud Heights building/floor analogy. Then explain why separating systems into smaller network ranges can help security.

```
A VNet is like an entire apartment building, while a subnet is like one floor inside the building. My student subnet is 10.60.6.0/26. Separating systems into smaller networks makes them easier to manage, and when access controls are used, it helps to prevent security problems from spreading. 
```

### 5. The Ladder Rule Has a Map Now

The Ladder Rule never used the words OSI or TCP/IP. Explain how the layer models give you a map for the same troubleshooting process you have already been using.

```
The Ladder Rule teaches me to test the closest thing first and work outward. The OSI and TCP/IP models help me understand which part of the connection I'm testing. Instead of guessing what's broken, I can check the network layer, transport layer, or application layer to narrow down the problem. 
```
